A website for a italian restaurant

Using the top bar you can move from page to page. Allowing you to look at the menu and leave a message for the restaurant.

Technologies used(.html, .css)

In the future I could work on:

Giving some padding to the carousel so it doesn't take up the whole space

Learn to give sections different colored backgrounds

And ask for help more offen when I get stuck
